This week's reading included Being in the World(of Warcraft) by Golub and My Life as a Night Elf Priest by Nardi.  Golub's piece did not make me react as strongly, thus I decided to focus more on Nardi's text for this blog.  Going into this reading, I didn't know much about WoW from personal experience.  I've sat over my brother's shoulders and watched bright colored characters roam around the screen while listening to the constant *click, click, click* of the mouse.  I have a bit of experience with League of Legends (LoL) so can apply that experience to learning about WoW under the assumption that there are many similarities within the online cultures - though someone else may refute that claim. I am only a casual gamer. Then again some might even consider me more casual than the casual gamer.  When reading Nardi's ethnography, she spent a good chunk of the beginning of the text talking about how she was new to games and did not know much about them.  She later claimed that she was "aware of how foreign they (games) seem to many, even how pointless, simplistic, fatuous." (8) - but I couldn't help but feel through the duration of the piece that she was still part of that "noob" demographic.  It just felt hard to credit her work as she continued to express how new she was to it.  It almost felt forced as she tried to become part of this particular online culture.  She claims that "World of Warcraft is more open to females and older players than games such as first-person shooters".  She does not back that claim up.  What is it about a game that she thinks this culture becomes more open to females?  Is it the people, is it the graphics, etc? It almost felt to me that she personally felt more comfortable in the space than other games she may have also tried due to the fact that (as she previously mentions) it is hard to know people's genders in the game unless you hear their voice.  Though, even then, voices can also be hard to determine gender from.  Many times that I have played games while conversing with other players I have been mistaken for a very young boy due to my voice.  This past week at the Grace Hopper Conference, I went to an amazing talk about gender in gaming that included our adviser for CCIS's group for women in technology.  I can not back the statistic up with a physical resource, but the credited speakers elaborated that about half of the people playing games are indeed women - it is not a male dominated arena as many think.  One of the women said that her favorite games ended up being those that she was able to run around and shoot things (referring to first person shooter games). And I can speak to that too â€“ as through my experience with games, I would much rather play a FPS than an MMORPG.
