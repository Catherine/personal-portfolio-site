<p>Before this class, I have not had much exposure to Second Life other than a professor that briefly talked about her research within it. When it comes to the field of Computer Science, I am very much interested in the development of interfaces and the experiences that result due to a person's interaction with it.  So as we begin to delve into exploring the Second Life community, I am very interested in learning about the interface and the usability of it since I have had little interaction with it previously.  The makers of Second Life must have done something right when they were building the UI (user interface) for the community - user's would not have been so keen on spending time in it if interaction with the space wasn't relatively easy.  I am curious as to how the development of the SL community might have impacted and influenced changes in the layout and function of the interface.

I found his discussion of the term "virtual" intriguing.  He says that "Virtuality can thus be understood in terms of potentiality (Massumi 2002:30); it can be said to exist whenever there is a perceived gap between experience and "the actual." This is now the most important meaning of "virtual" with regard to virtual worlds; "virtual" connotes approaching the actual without arriving there."(19)  As we had the discussion in class about if one's online presence is an extension of one's self, Boellstorff works to point out the distinction between our "online" and "offline" presence.  Such distinctions of referring to interactions not in a "virtual reality" and to what is happening within the "real world" pose the idea that the virtual world is not an extension of the real world, but an entirely separate entity that people can participate in.

I also thought that his conversation about whether or not Second Life (SL) can be considered a game or not was interesting and that the comment from one of the people he interacted with in SL posed a good argument: "Stadiums and Casinos. Venues for games? Yes. Games? No. Canvas and paint? Artistic medium? Yes. Game? No. A neighborhood bar? Social scene? Yes. Game? No ... Don't confuse the container with the contents. SL is no more a game than a box of crayons." (22) Throughout this blog post, I have tried to stay away from referring to Second Life as a game for the reason that I am undecided if I consider it one myself.  I think further interaction with the community (community being the word choice for Second Life that I have been trying to stick to throughout my blog) is needed for me to determine how to classify it - as in the past I would just have referred to it as a game due to my lack of understanding of how it is used.

It is later said that "Actual-world sociality cannot explain virtual-world sociality," and I agree with that because users can recreate themselves and act in ways different than they would in the physical world when they are interacting in a virtual space.  Their actions might not be representational in a virtual society of what they would do in the "real world."  Events and identities that are represented in the virtual world may reference what may be done in the real world, but cannot be explained the same way due to the change in context the virtual world provides.  Moving forward, I am really interested in further seeing and understanding how the virtual space impacts the actions of people.
